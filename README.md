# Multiagent Workflows

Welcome to the **Multiagent Workflows** repository! This repository showcases projects that demonstrate the power of multi-agent systems using advanced AI frameworks like **LlamaIndex** and **LangChain's LangGraph**. Multi-agent systems are composed of multiple specialized AI agents working collaboratively to solve complex tasks efficiently.

## Overview

### What are Multi-Agent Systems?
Multi-agent systems function like teams of specialized workers, each with unique expertise. These agents collaborate to accomplish intricate workflows that would be challenging for a single entity to handle alone. By leveraging frameworks like LangGraph, we can structure these agents into dynamic workflows where each agent contributes to the overall task.

### Key Concepts
- **Agents**: Independent actors powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), each with its own configuration.
- **Collaboration**: Agents share information using a common "scratchpad," enabling transparent communication.
- **LangGraph Framework**: A tool that structures agents as nodes in a graph, with edges representing communication and control conditions guiding data flow.

## Projects
This repository contains several projects that exemplify multi-agent workflows:

### 1. **Flashcard Generator with LlamaIndex**
   - **Description**: A system that generates high-quality Anki flashcards from any text input using a multi-agent approach.
   - **Features**:
     - Text analysis to extract key points.
     - Collaborative agent workflow to ensure card quality.
     - Easy-to-integrate output for Anki flashcards.
   - **Technologies**:
     - [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai/) for text parsing and analysis.
     - Multi-agent collaboration for quality assurance.

### 2. **Collaborative Multi-Agent Workflow**
   - **Description**: A more complex system featuring multiple agents, each with a specific role, working together on a shared task.
   - **Features**:
     - Dynamic agent connections modeled as a graph.
     - State management for tracking agent progress.
     - Conditional logic to guide task flow.
   - **Technologies**:
     - LangChain's LangGraph for graph-based agent design.
     - Flexible prompts and tools tailored to each agent.
